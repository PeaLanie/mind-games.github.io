                Most of our day-to-day tasks that are mostly done by computers or computer programs; I believe that our mind are capable of doing them. I think somewhere down the line, people just got lazy to think and so they developed computer programs to handle most of the tasks that should be done by our brains. These task as of now have become countless. One of those tasks is counting with our God given brains. We have become so reliant on calculators that it is so difficult to even add up very simple numbers; intergers. What kind of numbers are intergers? Intergers are numbers without a decimal point (e.g. 1, 2, 3,...55, 99, 100, even zero and the negative side of these numbers)
