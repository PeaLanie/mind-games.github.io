            <h1>Basic Addition: Intergers with single digits; 1-9</h1>
            <p id="currentDate"></p>
            <br>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the "<i>Basic Addition</i>" game, which is not really a game because being stuck on adding up basic easy numbers is not really a game; it's embarasing. Adding basic numbers such as 1-9 shouldn't be a hustle. We have built this game to make it easy for everyone. At the end of this game you should be able to add up numbers like, this: 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 + 1, like a pro.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here at <a href="../../index.html">Mechine Brain</a> we are going to teach you our theory behind adding intergers (Note: the use of <strong>intergers</strong> (whole numbers) is intensonal, because our theory is reliant on numbers with no decimals). At the beginning it will feel dounting and difficult, but with a little bit of practice; you should see the difference.
                </p>
            <h2>The Theory:</h2>
                <p>
                    (Think you already now how to add natural numbers? <a href="#theGameSection">Jump straight to the game</a>)<br><br>When adding a list of numbers like: 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 + 1, the trick is to simplify the list of digits into easy numbers that can be added with little effort. In the list above, wouldn't it be easy to first add 9 and 1? Yes! Because 9 and 1 adds up to 10. 7 and 3 also adds up to 10. Now you know that you're left with 4. By adding 10 (which is 9 + 1) and 10 (which is 7 + 3) and 4 it is easy to conclude that the sum is 24.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always try to simplify numbers to either 10 or 5, simply because it is much easier to add those than the numbers in between (Always think...which numbers to add first!). Look at the diagrams below which further illustrates this point:
                </p>
            <h4>
                <strong>How to add up a list of real numbers between 1 and 9?</strong><br><br>Example #1
            </h4>
            <br>
                <p>
                    There's probably many ways you can go about adding these numbers. But in this course we trieve to find "the easiest" path to the sum! Follow the steps below:
                </p>
            <div class="stepsAndIllustrations">
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>
                        Fill in both the numbers 9 to make them 10 (<i>simplification</i> that we spoke about before). A reasonable question would be; fill them with what?!<br><br>Well as you can see from the diagram on the right, we take 2 from 4, distribute it amongst the 9's, which leave us with the following new list: 8 + 2 + 10 + 10 + 7
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The following step is to add 8 and 2, which make the list very easy to sum up by now.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The final step is to add all the 10's and the 7, which clearly equals to 37.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <div>
                    <img src="../../images/image1.png" id="img1" class="illustrationImgs" alt="list of random numbers">
                    <img src="../../images/image2.png" id="img2" class="illustrationImgs" alt="solution to the list above">
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h4>Example #2</h4>
            <br>
                <p>
                    The first thing you want to do is to scan your list in order to find simple ways to add your numbers. After that it's only just a matter of memory...what do I mean? Once you've simplified your numbers, you got to always remember the modification done.
                </p>
            <div class="stepsAndIllustrations">
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>
                        Take the 2 in the end and split it between the 9's. The new list is: 10 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 0, but since 0 is nothing, you can throw it away.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The second obvious step is to split 7 into 2 and 5 to simplify our list. It's easier to add 5's and 10's than it is to add 7,6,9 and so on.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Adding the 5's gives us a much simpler list of 10's and a 2.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Final answer is 32
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <div>
                    <img src="../../images/image3.png" id="img3" class="illustrationImgs" alt="list of random numbers">
                    <img src="../../images/image4.png" id="img4" class="illustrationImgs" alt="solution to the list above">
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h4>Example #3</h4>
            <br>
                <p>
                    As always, scan through your list and find the most efficient but effective way to add your numbers. Look through the steps below to familiarize yourself with the method.
                </p>
            <div class="stepsAndIllustrations">
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>
                        First add 2 and 8 which equals 10. Split 8 in between to get two seperate 4's, take one 4 and add with 6 to get another 10. Here is the new list: 10 + 10 + 4 + 7
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        To make the list much simpler, we split 4 into 1 and 3. Take that 3 add it to 7 to once again get another 10. Here is the new list: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        By now it's pretty obvious the answer is: 31
                    </li><br>
                </ol>
                <div>
                    <img src="../../images/image5.png" id="img5" class="illustrationImgs" alt="list of random numbers">
                    <img src="../../images/image6.png" id="img6" class="illustrationImgs" alt="solution to the list above">
                </div>
            </div>
            <br><hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                By now the trick should be clear; all the steps are done in your mind.<br><br>In visual form it all looks too much, but once you get the hang of it, speed will improve its self. So, in the beginning, focus more on being accurate, understanding the steps and how it is done. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another trick is to practice more. Luckily, we have designed games to help you practice what you've just learned above. My advice would be to stay longer in the basic addition practice mode, because all the following methods of adding double, triple and more digits is dependant on these basics.
